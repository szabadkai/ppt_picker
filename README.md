# PreziPicker

deployed to: https://prezi-picker.herokuapp.com/

# How this could be improved:
    * db/cache instead of memory storage, I'd probably go with elasticsearch.
    * more comprehensive testsuit, for both the angular and flask apps
    * proper deployment on dynos set up for node and python not just python, as currently it is.
    * no dist/ in code repo.
    * better ui.
    * automatic/triggered indexing of data.
